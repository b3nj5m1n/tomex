# Import

## Required fields in Goodreads format
- Title (seems necessary to have _some_ value, but anything might work, although it seems to be faster when it's actually the title)
- Author (seems very necessary, tried putting just anything and 40 mins later the import (of one item) is still not complete. They could also be rate limiting me, but this information is easily available anyways)
- Read Count might not be necessary but seems like a good idea
